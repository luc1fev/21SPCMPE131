<p>The Account Management service allows you to establish individual account access levels (including customized access to Bill Pay) in online banking.&nbsp;There is a monthly fee for Account Management of $15.00, which is waived for the first three (3) calendar months after enrollment in the service. The monthly fee for Account Management is waived when you have Business Advantage Checking.</p>

										&#66;. Creating and Managing Users
								</h4>
							</div>
								<p></p>
<p>You may authorize other users and control their scope of activities by designating user levels, access levels, and account settings.&nbsp; You may add additional users to your online banking profile and provide each with a separate Online ID and passcode.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>User Level</li>
</ol>
<p>You may designate the user level either as &ldquo;user&rdquo; (also sometimes referred to as &ldquo;sub-user&rdquo;) or &ldquo;Administrator.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Administrator is a user who is able to create additional users, edit and monitor other users. &nbsp;An Administrator is not eligible to enroll in other Business Services or grant levels of access to other users that have not been granted to the Administrator.</p>
<p>For each user, you can designate which account(s) the user will have access to. You may also place limits on the types of transactions for each account to which the user is granted access.</p>
<p>For each account linked to your Online ID, except for personal investment accounts, you can designate each user's access level and account settings.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> </strong>Access Level</li>
</ol>
<p>Access Level (also sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Activity Level&rdquo;) means either <strong>Transactional Access</strong>, <strong>View Access</strong> or <strong>No Access</strong>.</p>
<p>You agree that users have <strong>Transactional Access</strong>, unless otherwise specified by you or an Administrator. You agree that by granting Transactional Access (also sometimes referred to as &ldquo;financial access&rdquo; or &ldquo;full access&rdquo;) to an account you will be allowing a user to transfer funds, make payments, perform account maintenance, and view account balances and activity on the account, subject to the selected account or general service settings.</p>
<p><strong>View Access</strong> (also sometimes referred to as &ldquo;inquiry access&rdquo; or &ldquo;basic access&rdquo;) allows a user to only view account balances and activity, subject to the selected account or general service settings.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> </strong>Account Settings</li>
</ol>
<p>Account settings are levels of access and transactional limits that you and/or an Administrator may select for each user.</p>
<p>In addition to specifying Transactional, View, or No Access for a user of an account, you can also specify certain other account settings, including transaction limitations as provided on our web site. You may also designate certain "general service settings," which are global settings that may affect more than one account. These include Full Access Bill Pay, Payroll Services and Direct Payments.</p>
<p>There are additional controls available for the Bill Pay option. If you select to enable <strong>Full Access</strong> for a user, that user will automatically have Transactional Access to all the accounts that you have set up for Bill Pay, and the user will be able to pay bills using the Bill Pay feature and set up new payees. You may, however, designate <strong>Limited Access</strong> for a user of Bill Pay, which will permit the user to have Transactional Access for specific accounts and existing payees only. For the Bill Pay functionality, you may limit a user to use only certain specified accounts. For users of the Payroll Services and Direct Payments, only Transactional Access is available.</p>
<p>In addition to designating general service settings, you can also provide additional account settings on certain eligible accounts, such as allowing a user to view statements, view check images or make transfers for the selected accounts. Any user to whom you have given transfer ability will be able to see the last name and last 4 digits of the account number for all transfer recipients created by you, an Administrator or any other user, even those that the user did not initiate.</p>

				<p>If you are authorized to enter into an agreement for a Business Service for another business, and if you want to link the accounts of the other business to the accounts covered by the agreement in online banking, you will need to agree separately to the Agreements for each other business. Upon doing so, you may link the accounts of the businesses so that you may elect, at your risk and that of the businesses, but not of the Bank, to use a common Online ID and passcode to access all linked accounts in online banking. You should do this only if you are authorized to link the accounts of the different business and to use all the functions of online banking for each business.</p>
<p>You may also link an eligible Bank of America consumer account to the accounts covered by the Agreements in online banking. You may link eligible accounts only if you are the owner of the business account and the consumer account. If you link your business accounts to your consumer accounts, you agree and understand that the owner Online ID provides the ability to view and/or perform transactions with linked consumer accounts.</p>
<p>You are obligated to inform Bank of America if your authority over any linked account decreases. The Bank is not liable if your authority over any account decreases until it is informed of the change in authority using the Notice Requirements in Section 2 of the Addendum above.</p>

									<h3>Advertising Practices</h3>
										<p>We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.</p>
<p>If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may <a onclick="$('.ui-dialog').remove();" name="WebsiteAdPractices_OptOut" href="../information/language-not-available/index-target=https---www.bankofamerica.com-privacy-online-privacy-notice.go-request_locale=en_US.html#advertising-on-our-sites" target="_blank">opt out of online behavioral advertising</a>. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.</p>
<p>Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.</p>
<p>To learn more about relationship-based ads, online behavioral advertising and our privacy practices, please review the <a onclick="$('.ui-dialog').remove();" name="WebsiteAdPractices_PrivacyNotice" href="../information/language-not-available/index-target=https---www.bankofamerica.com-privacy-online-privacy-notice.go-request_locale=en_US.html" target="_blank">Bank of America Online Privacy Notice</a> and our <a onclick="$('.ui-dialog').remove();" name="Online-privacy-faqs" href="../information/language-not-available/index-target=https---www.bankofamerica.com-privacy-faq-online-privacy-faq.go-request_locale=en_US.html" target="_blank">Online Privacy FAQs</a>.</p>
