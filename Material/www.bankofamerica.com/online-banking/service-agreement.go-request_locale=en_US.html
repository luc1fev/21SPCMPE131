<p>This Agreement is between each owner of an eligible account, a person applying for an eligible account, or authorized representative appointed or entitled to online access on another person&rsquo;s behalf (&ldquo;you&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;) and Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America).&nbsp; This Agreement governs your use of any online or mobile banking services maintained by Bank of America and accessible through bankofamerica.com using a personal computer or a mobile device, including a smartphone, tablet, or any other eligible handheld or wearable communication device (the &ldquo;Service(s)&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Under the terms of this Agreement, you may use the Services to obtain financial products and services, access and view account information, and, for certain accounts, move money electronically and perform authorized transactions, for eligible U.S.-based Bank of America consumer and small business accounts and affiliate accounts linked to the Service, such as those at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated ("Merrill").</p>
<p>When used in the Agreement, the term &ldquo;small business&rdquo; includes sole proprietors, non-consumer business entities, and individual owners of the business, unless the context indicates otherwise. If you are a small business customer, additional or different terms and conditions applicable to the Services, as well as additional Services available exclusively to small business customers, are included in the Business Services Addendum, which is a part of this Agreement.</p>
<p>When you first set up your Online/Mobile ID, we will link all of your eligible Bank of America and affiliate accounts, including joint accounts. If you open an additional eligible account at a later date, we will link your new account to the Service, unless you tell us not to do so. Unless indicated otherwise by the context, "linked Bank of America accounts" or "linked accounts" refers to all of your accounts with Bank of America and its affiliates that are linked to the Service.</p>
<p>When your Service is linked to one or more joint accounts, we may act on the verbal, written or electronic instructions of any authorized signer.</p>
<p>Please note that some of the Services may not be available when using certain digital devices or applications. For example, some functions may be available online through a personal computer but not available through our mobile app.</p>

			<p>Your use of the Services may also be affected by your Deposit Agreement and Disclosures, including the applicable schedule of fees (&ldquo;Deposit Agreement&rdquo;), or other agreement with us for your linked Bank of America accounts and/or an agreement with our affiliates for your affiliate accounts linked to the Service, including your investment accounts at Merrill. When an account is linked to the Services, it does not change the agreements you already have with us or our affiliates for that account and you are still subject to the terms and conditions we gave you in the agreement and disclosure for the linked account. The terms and conditions for those account agreements, including any applicable fees, transaction limitations, liability rules and other restrictions that might impact your use of an account with the Services, are incorporated into this Agreement. &nbsp;In the event of a conflict between the terms of those account agreements and this Agreement, the terms of the applicable account agreement will prevail unless this Agreement specifically states otherwise.</p>
<p>If you use the Services to move money between your investment accounts governed by the Merrill Lynch Brokerage Website Terms and Conditions, which you agreed to when you became a Merrill online customer, that agreement, and not this Agreement will apply to your transaction.</p>

		<div class="h-100">
			<h4 id="cat3_topic1">
					A. Bill Pay for Checking, Money Market and Home Equity Line of Credit Accounts
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p></p>
<p>Bank of America customers may use Bill Pay to make payments to companies or individuals (&ldquo;Payees&rdquo;) in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payments can be scheduled from linked checking, money market savings, and HELOC accounts during the draw period. Note that you may not link HELOC accounts opened in Texas.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Payments can be scheduled from a checking, money market savings or other consumer asset account maintained at another financial institution that you have added to Bill Pay. You certify that any account you add to Bill Pay is an account from which you are authorized to make payments, and any payment you make using Bill Pay will debit an account that you are legally authorized to use. When you add an account maintained at another financial institution, you do not change the agreements you have with that financial institution for that account. Please review those agreements for any applicable fees, limitations on the number of transactions you can make, and for other restrictions that might limit your use of the account with Bill Pay.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Payments can be entered as a one-time transaction up to a year in advance, recurring transactions or as payments that are automatically scheduled upon the receipt of an electronic bill (e-Bill).<br /><br /></li>
<li>Future scheduled or recurring payments that fall on a weekend or a non-business day will be processed on the prior business day.<br /><br /></li>
<li>You authorize us to make payments in the manner we select from the following methods:
<ul>
<li>Electronic transmission. Most payments are made by electronic transmission.</li>
<li>Corporate check &ndash; This is a check drawn on our account or the account of our vendor. If a Payee on a corporate check fails to negotiate the check within ninety (90) days, we will stop payment on the check and re-credit your account for the amount of the payment. If a corporate check is returned to you prior to the end of the ninety (90) day period, please inform us immediately so that we can stop payment on the check and re-credit your account.</li>
<li>Personal check &ndash; This is a check drawn on your account when it is presented for payment.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All payments under Bill Pay that are sent care of APO/FPO or similar addresses will be sent by corporate or personal check. Because all such payments will be made by check, they will not be Remittance Transfers (as defined in section 5.F. of this Agreement).<br /><br /></li>
<li>Any obligations that you wish to pay through Bill Pay must be payable in U.S. dollars to a Payee located in the United States. We reserve the right to restrict categories of Payees to whom payments may be made using the Service. We recommend that you not use the Service to make:
<ul>
<li>Tax payments</li>
<li>Court-ordered payments</li>
<li>Payments to settle securities transactions<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scheduling Bill Payments
<ul>
<li>The scheduled delivery date is the date you enter for the payment to be delivered to the Payee. For payments made by electronic transmission or corporate check, the payment amount will be debited from the account that you designate on the scheduled delivery date. For payments made by personal check, the account you designate will be debited when the check is presented to us for payment which may occur before, on or after the scheduled delivery date.</li>
<li>Payments (other than payments to a Bank of America Payee) initiated before 5:00 p.m. ET on a business day will be scheduled and begin processing on the same business day. Payments that are entered after this cut-off time or on a day that is a non-business day will be scheduled and processed the next bank business day.</li>
<li>For payments to a Bank of America Payee, such as a vehicle loan, HELOC or mortgage, Bank of America will process and credit the payment to the account effective the same business day, provided the payment is scheduled prior to the 5:00 p.m. ET cut-off.</li>
<li>For payments to Bank of America credit card and business line of credit accounts, Bank of America will process and credit the payment to the account effective the same day, provided the payment is scheduled prior to the 11:59 p.m. ET cut-off.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bill Discovery Service. At your option, we may offer you the opportunity to add Payees from our service provider&rsquo;s network or, with your consent, to access your credit report to help you identify Payees which you would like to add to this service.&nbsp; Information from these sources may make it easier for you to make payments or add relevant e-bills to your Service.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>When you attempt to schedule a payment, we will inform you of the earliest available delivery date. To assure timely payment and obtain the full benefit of the Online Banking Guarantee described below, you must schedule payments, and your account must be in good standing and have sufficient available funds in the designated deposit account to cover the payment, at least five (5) bank business days before the payment due date, NOT the date after which late payment fees may be assessed.</p>
<p>If an account does not have sufficient available funds on the scheduled date, we may elect not to initiate one or more of the transfers. If we do elect to initiate the transfer, which may involve one or more attempts on subsequent business days, it may cause an overdraft in your account in which case you shall be fully responsible for the overdraft and any overdraft fees, as set forth in your Deposit Agreement, as well as all late fees, interest charges or other action taken by the Payee.</p>
<p>Under our Online Banking Guarantee, if we fail to process a payment in accordance with your properly completed instructions, we will reimburse you for any late payment fees. As indicated above, some payments may be made by a personal check. Since we can't predict the exact date that a personal check will be presented to us for payment, please make sure you have sufficient funds in your account beginning a few days before your scheduled delivery date and keep such funds available until the payment is deducted from your account.</p>
<p>Bill Pay payments sent via corporate or personal check with different Payee names may be combined in one envelope if those payments have the same mailing address, and your intended Payee has not registered their full/unique mailing address with the USPS, including their secondary address designation, e.g., Suite, Room, Floor, Dept., Building, or Unit. If we need to, we&rsquo;ll change or reformat your Payee account number to match the account number or format required by your Payee for electronic payment processing and eBill activation.</p>

					E. Receiving Money; Money Transfers by Network Banks
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p></p>
<p>Once a User initiates a transfer of money to your email address or mobile phone number enrolled with the Service, you have no ability to stop the transfer. By using the Service, you agree and authorize us to initiate credit entries to the bank account you have enrolled.</p>
<p>Most transfers of money to you from other Users will occur within minutes. There may be other circumstances when the payment may take longer. For example, in order to protect you, us, <em>Zelle</em> and the other Network Banks, we may need or <em>Zelle</em> may need additional time to verify your identity or the identity of the person sending the money. We may also delay or block the transfer to prevent fraud or to meet our regulatory obligations. If we block a payment that you have initiated through a request for money, we will notify you by email.</p>
<p>If you are receiving a payment from a business or government agency, your payment will be delivered in accordance with both this Agreement and the procedures of the business or government agency that is sending you the payment.</p>

					F. Sending Money; Debits by Network Banks
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p></p>
<p>You may send money to another User at your initiation or in response to that User&rsquo;s request for money. You understand that use of this Service by you shall at all times be subject to (i) this Agreement, and (ii) your express authorization at the time of the transaction for us or another Network Bank to initiate a debit entry to your bank account. You understand that when you send the payment, you will have no ability to stop it. You may only cancel a payment if the person to whom you sent the money has not yet enrolled in the Service.&nbsp; If the person you sent money to has already enrolled with <em>Zelle</em>, either in the <em>Zelle</em> mobile app or with a Network Bank, the money is sent directly to their bank account (except as otherwise provided below) and may not be canceled or revoked.</p>
<p>In most cases, when you are sending money to another user, the transfer will occur in minutes; however, there are circumstances when the payment may take longer. For example, in order to protect you, us, <em>Zelle</em> and the other Network Banks, we may need additional time to verify your identity or the identity of the person receiving the money. During this period, and in any other circumstance when we need additional time to verify the transfer details, a hold will be placed on your account for the amount of the transfer. You understand and acknowledge that a person to whom you are sending money and who is not enrolled as a User may fail to register with <em>Zelle</em>, or otherwise ignore the payment notification, and the transfer may not occur. If the person to whom you are sending money does not enroll, set up an email address or mobile number and accept the transfer within 14 days, the transfer will be canceled.</p>
<p>The money may also be delayed or the transfer may be blocked to prevent fraud or comply with regulatory requirements. We will notify you by email if we block a payment that you have initiated using the Service.</p>
<p>We have no control over the actions of other Users, other Network Banks or other financial institutions that could delay or prevent your money from being delivered to the intended User.</p>

If a User ignores your request, we may decide or <em>Zelle</em> may decide, in our sole discretion, that we will not send a reminder or repeat request to that User.</p>
<p>By accepting this Agreement, you agree that you are not engaging in the business of debt collection by attempting to use the Service to request money for the payment or collection of an overdue or delinquent debt; to request money that is owed to another person; or to collect any amounts that are owed pursuant to a court order.&nbsp;You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us, <em>Zelle</em>, our and their owners, directors, officers agents and Network Banks from and against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and costs (including, but not limited to, direct, incidental, consequential, exemplary and indirect damages), and reasonable attorney's fees, resulting from or arising out of any request for money that you send that is related to overdue or delinquent amounts.</p>
<p>You agree to receive money requests from other Users, and to only send requests for legitimate and lawful purposes. Requests for money are solely between the sender and recipient and are not reviewed or verified by us or by <em>Zelle</em>. Neither we nor <em>Zelle</em> assume responsibility for the accuracy or legality of such requests and do not act as a debt collector on your behalf or on behalf of the sender of a request for money.</p>
<p>We reserve the right, but assume no obligation, to terminate your ability to send requests for money in general, or to specific recipients, if we deem such requests to be potentially unlawful, abusive, offensive or unwelcome by the recipient.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>/ For Direct Payments Service, see the Business Services Addendum for details on fees and limits.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>/ Higher limits may apply for Bank of America Private Bank or Merrill. You may be eligible for higher limits if you enroll in SafePass. Learn more about <a href="../security-center/online-mobile-banking-privacy/safepass/index.html" name="SafePass" target="_blank">SafePass</a>.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>/ You will be charged $25 for each transfer trace that you ask us to execute for you. International transfers may be subject to additional fees charged by intermediary, receiving and beneficiary banks.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>/ To be eligible to receive a next business-day ACH transfer, you must first have received an aggregate of $500.00 in one or more three business day ACH transfers, and the first three business day ACH transfer must have been at least 60 days prior to the first next business day ACH transfer.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>/ For international outbound transfers, funds will be debited from your Bank of America account on the business day you direct us to initiate processing of the transfer. Bank of America will send the payment out on that business day and, except for Remittance Transfers the beneficiary&rsquo;s bank typically receives the funds 1 to 2 business days later and the funds typically will be credited to the beneficiary within 2 business days. See Section 5.F for special rules applicable to Remittance Transfers.</p>
<p>ACH/Wires send limits are set at the customer profile (Online ID) and apply to all accounts visible in the &ldquo;From&rdquo; dropdown when initiating an ACH/Wire payment. If you are a Small Business customer and are not receiving the Small Business limits, make sure you are signed in with your Small Business Online ID.</p>
<p>You may also move money within the U.S. without a transfer fee by using Zelle (described in Section 4 above) or Bill Pay (described in Section 3 above). ACH and Wire transfers are alternatives that allow you to transfer funds when delivery of funds domestically by a specific date is critical or when you are transferring funds outside the U.S.</p>

<li>You will need to provide certain identifying information about each non-Bank of America account in order to register that account for this Service. For inbound transfers, you agree that you will only attempt to register non-Bank of America personal accounts that you own or for which you have the authority to transfer funds. Same-Business-Day Wire transfers are not available for inbound transfers. Transfers to accounts located outside the United States are available for outbound transfers only and are subject to the delivery times indicated above. Next-Business-Day and Three-Business-Day ACH transfers are not available for international transfers.</li>
<li>Bank of America cannot guarantee the timely delivery or return of funds as a result of the failure of another financial institution to act in a timely manner. Please note that beneficiary banks located in some countries may take several days or even weeks to credit the receiving account. There may be some risk in making a transfer to a slow-to-pay country. Currency conversion charges also may apply to international outbound transfers.</li>
<li>For each transfer, we will e-mail a confirmation to you at the e-mail address indicated in our records. The confirmation will note the date and the amount of the transfer and the bank or institution to or from which the transfer was made. You agree to examine the confirmation promptly upon receipt and to notify us immediately of any discrepancy between the confirmation and your records. Bank of America will not be liable for interest compensation, as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, unless Bank of America is notified of the discrepancy within 30 days from the date of your receipt of the confirmation or your bank statement including the transfer, whichever is earlier. You acknowledge and agree that if a payment order relating to a transfer describes a beneficiary inconsistently by name and account number, payment might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of the account number, even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary, and that your obligation to pay the transfer issued by you to us shall not be excused by such payment.</li>
<li>You agree that you will have sufficient available funds in the designated deposit account to cover all outbound transfers on the date scheduled. If an account does not have sufficient available funds on the scheduled date, we may elect not to initiate one or more of the transfers. If we do elect to initiate the transfer, which may involve one or more attempts on subsequent business days, it may cause an overdraft in your account in which case you shall be liable for the overdraft and any overdraft fees, as set forth in your Deposit Agreement.</li>
<li>You agree that Bank of America may use any means or routes which we in our sole discretion consider suitable to execute your transfer. For small business customers, if you transfer funds in U.S. dollars to a non-U.S. dollar account, your payment may be converted into the local currency by any originating, intermediary or receiving bank, payment system or payment service provider, including Bank of America or an affiliate, as applicable. We and/or an affiliate include a mark-up or fee on such currency conversion and may profit in connection with any such currency conversion.&nbsp;Bank of America hereby gives notice that Same-Business-Day domestic transfers and international outbound transfers may be executed through Fedwire, a funds transfer system operated by the Federal Reserve Banks, through CHIPS (Clearing House Interbank Payments System), a funds transfer system operated by The Clearing House or through SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication). With respect to payment orders relating to the transfer which are executed through Fedwire, Federal Reserve Regulation J and all applicable Federal Reserve operating rules shall govern the payment orders. With respect to payment orders relating to the transfer which are executed through CHIPS, the CHIPS Operating Rules shall govern the payment orders. With respect to payment orders relating to the transfer which are executed through SWIFT, the SWIFT operating rules shall govern the payment orders. However, with respect to Remittance Transfers, to the extent of any inconsistencies between the above referenced rules and the provisions of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act ("EFTA"), the provisions of EFTA shall prevail. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the rights and obligations that apply to Remittance Transfers are set forth in the EFTA and, as applicable, as set forth in New York law. Three-Business-Day ACH transfers and Next-Business-Day ACH transfers may be made through the Automated Clearing House processor selected by us or directly to another bank, and you agree will be subject to the National Automated Clearing House Association rules or our agreement with the other bank, in effect at such time, as applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future scheduled or recurring transfers scheduled for a weekend or a non-business day will be processed on the prior business day.</p>

Bank of America may at its option accept your cancellations or amendments to a transfer. You acknowledge that if Bank of America attempts to cancel or amend a transfer, then the reversal request or amendment must be agreed to by each financial institution which has accepted a payment order related to the transfer at issue before it will be acted upon and you further agree that Bank of America shall have no liability if a cancellation or amendment is not completed.</li>
<li>Except for Remittance Transfers, you can cancel future scheduled and recurring domestic transfers prior to midnight ET on the date processing for the transfer is scheduled to be initiated by accessing the Transfers page and selecting To/From my accounts at other banks or To someone else or business This is the preferred method for cancelling transfers.

<li>Once an international outbound transfer has been sent, or, in the case of Remittance Transfers, after the 30 minute cancellation period has passed, you may request that a transfer be recalled, and we will communicate your request to the beneficiary's bank. If the beneficiary's bank agrees to return the funds to us, then upon confirmation of receipt of funds in our account, we will credit your account at the current Bank of America retail buy rate for that currency that day (see below). Please note that the exchange rate may be different from the original rate applicable to the transfer, which may result in a loss to you. Furthermore, the beneficiary's bank may assess charges for their services, which will be deducted from the amount returned to you. We will have no liability to you if the beneficiary's bank or foreign beneficiary refuses your request to recall the international wire transfer.</li>
<li>If a transfer is returned by the receiving bank or beneficiary's bank for no fault of ours, we will credit your account at the current Bank of America retail buy rate for the currency that day (see below). Please note that the exchange rate will be different from the original rate applicable to the transfer, which may result in a loss to you. Furthermore, a returning bank and/or beneficiary's bank may assess charges for their services, which will be deducted from the amount returned to you.</li>

					F. Special Rules for Remittance Transfers
			</h4>

<ul>
<li>As described above, a Remittance Transfer is an electronic transfer of funds initiated by a consumer primarily for personal, family or household purposes to a designated recipient in a foreign country. Federal law provides certain rights and obligations related to Remittance Transfers that may differ from rights and obligations that apply to other types of funds transfers, including disclosure, cancellation and error resolution rights. Your rights with respect to Remittance Transfers will be explained to you in a disclosure provided to you at the time you initiate each Remittance Transfer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

In addition, if you chose to transfer money in foreign currency, the disclosures will also include the following items in such foreign currency: (x) the transfer amount, (y) the fees imposed by third parties in connection with the transfer, and (z) the total amount to be received by the recipient (which is the difference between (x) and (y) above.) Please note the recipient may receive less than the total amount disclosed due to foreign taxes and fees charged by the recipient&rsquo;s financial institution for receiving a Remittance Transfer into an account, which are not required to be disclosed.
<ul>
<li>Once you confirm your acceptance of the Remittance Transfer terms, you will be shown a receipt which includes the items listed above and, in addition, (i) the date the funds will be available to the recipient, (ii) information you provide that identifies the recipient, and (iii) a statement of your rights in the event of an error or if you wish to cancel the transfer, as described below.</li>

					G. Currency Exchange Rates
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p></p>
<p>We may determine a currency exchange rate and assign it to your transaction without notice to you. Exchange rates fluctuate, at times significantly, and you acknowledge and accept all risks that may result from such fluctuations. If we assign an exchange rate to your foreign exchange transaction, that exchange rate will be determined by us in our sole discretion based upon such factors as we determine relevant, including without limitation, market conditions, exchange rates charged by other parties, our desired rate of return, market risk, credit risk and other market, economic and business factors, and is subject to change at any time without notice. You acknowledge that exchange rates for retail and commercial transactions, and for transactions effected after regular business hours and on weekends, are different from the exchange rates for large inter-bank transactions effected during the business day, as may be reported in The Wall Street Journal or elsewhere. Exchange rates offered by other dealers or shown at other sources by us or other dealers (including online sources) may be different from our exchange rates. The exchange rate you are offered may be different from, and likely inferior to, the rate paid by us to acquire the underlying currency. We reserve the right to refuse to process any request for a foreign exchange transaction.</p>
<p>We provide all-in pricing for exchange rates. The price provided may include profit, fees, costs, charges or other mark ups as determined by us in our sole discretion. The level of the fee or markup may differ for each customer and may differ for the same customer depending on the method or venue used for transaction execution.</p>
<p>We do not accept any liability for our exchange rates. Any and all liability for our exchange rates is disclaimed, including without limitation direct, indirect or consequential loss, and any liability if our exchange rates are different from rates offered or reported by third parties, or offered by us at a different time, at a different location, for a different transaction amount, or involving a different payment media (including but not limited to bank-notes, checks, wire transfers, etc.).</p>

<li>You need more information about a transaction listed on your statement</li>
<li>An unauthorized person has discovered your Online Banking passcode</li>
<li>Someone has transferred or may transfer money from your account without your permission</li>
</ul>
<p>We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we have sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared (or 90 days if the problem or error relates to a transfer from an account maintained at another financial institution).</p>
<p>If you tell us verbally, we may require you to send us your complaint or question in writing or via email within ten (10) business days (Online Banking customers may use secure online mail). When you contact us, please provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name and account number</li>

					B. Limitation of Liability for Online Banking Transactions
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p></p>
<p>Tell us at once if you believe your Online Banking passcode has been compromised or if someone has transferred or may transfer money from your account without your permission. The best way to minimize your loss is to call us immediately. The unauthorized use of your Online Banking services could cause you to lose all of your money in your accounts, plus any amount available under your overdraft protection plan.</p>
<p>You will have no liability for unauthorized transactions if you notify us within 60 days after the statement showing the transaction has been mailed to you (or 90 days if the transaction was from an account maintained at another financial institution). If you do not, you may not get back any of the money you lost from any unauthorized transaction that occurs after the close of the 60-day period (or 90 day period if the transaction was from an account maintained at another financial institution), if we can show that we could have stopped the transaction if you had notified us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods.</p>
<p>If you give your Online ID and passcode and grant authority to make transfers to a person who exceeds the authority given, you are responsible for all transactions that person performs unless you notify us that the transfers by that person are no longer authorized. Transactions that you or someone acting with you initiates with fraudulent intent are also authorized transactions.</p>
<p>Note: These liability rules are established by Regulation E, which implements the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act and does not apply to business accounts. Our liability policy regarding unauthorized Online Banking transactions on consumer deposit accounts may give you more protection, provided you report the transactions promptly. Also, the state law applicable to your account may give you more time to report an unauthorized transaction or may give you more protection.</p>

<p>If we do not complete a transaction to or from your account on time, or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, we will not be liable:</p>
<ul>
<li>If, through no fault of ours, you don't have enough available funds in your account (or available funds under your overdraft protection plan), or credit to cover the transaction or transfer</li>
<li>If Online Banking services weren't working properly, and you knew about the malfunction when you started the transaction or transfer</li>
<li>If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevented the transaction or transfer, despite reasonable precautions we've taken</li>
<li>If there are postal delays or processing delays by the Payee</li>
<li>There may be other exceptions not specifically mentioned</li>

					A. Protecting Passcodes
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p></p>
<p>If you think your passcode may have been compromised, or you believe there has been unauthorized or erroneous online activity with respect to your account, contact us at <strong>866.758.5972</strong>. If you are calling from outside of the continental U.S., call us collect at <strong>925.681.7600</strong>.</p>
<p>You agree that we may send notices and other communications, including passcode confirmations, to the current address shown in our records, whether or not that address includes a designation for delivery to the attention of any particular individual. You further agree that Bank of America will not be responsible or liable to you in any way if information is intercepted by an unauthorized person, either in transit or at your place of business. You agree to: 1) keep your passcode secure and strictly confidential, providing it only to authorized signers on your account(s); 2) instruct each person to whom you give your passcode that he or she is not to disclose it to any unauthorized person; and 3) immediately notify us and select a new passcode if you believe your passcode may have become known to an unauthorized person. Bank of America will have no liability to you for any unauthorized payment or transfer made using your passcode that occurs before you have notified us of possible unauthorized use and we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice. We may suspend or cancel your passcode even without receiving such notice from you, if we suspect your passcode is being used in an unauthorized or fraudulent manner. For businesses who use the additional services described in the Business Services Addendum, this section applies to all Online Banking passcodes, including those assigned to users or Administrators. You are responsible for all transactions performed by you and any designated user(s), including Administrator(s), whether you specifically authorize the transactions or not. If you notify us that the person is no longer authorized, then only transactions that person performs after the time you notify us are considered unauthorized.</p>

		</div>
			<p></p>
<p>If we fail or delay in making a payment or transfer pursuant to your instructions, or if we make a payment or transfer in an erroneous amount that is less than the amount per your instructions, unless otherwise required by law, our liability shall be limited to interest on the amount that we failed to timely pay or transfer, calculated from the date on which the payment or transfer was to be made until the date it was actually made or you canceled the instructions. We may pay such interest either to you or the intended recipient of the payment or transfer, but in no event will we be liable to both parties, and our payment to either party will fully discharge any obligation to the other. If we make a payment or transfer in an erroneous amount that exceeds the amount per your instructions, or if we permit an unauthorized payment or transfer after we have had a reasonable time to act on a notice from you of possible unauthorized use as described above, unless otherwise required by law, our liability will be limited to a refund of the amount erroneously paid or transferred, plus interest thereon from the date of the payment or transfer to the date of the refund, but in no event to exceed 60 days' interest. If we become liable to you for interest compensation under this Agreement or applicable law, such interest shall be calculated based on the average federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve Bank in the district where Bank of America is headquartered for each day interest is due, computed on the basis of a 360-day year. Unless otherwise required by law, in no event will Bank of America be liable to you for special, indirect or consequential damages including, without limitation, lost profits or attorney's fees, even if we are advised in advance of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>For the provisions governing our liability for ACH or Wire Transfers, please see Section 5.E above.</p>

									<h3>Advertising Practices</h3>
										<p>We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.</p>
<p>If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may <a onclick="$('.ui-dialog').remove();" name="WebsiteAdPractices_OptOut" href="../information/language-not-available/index-target=https---www.bankofamerica.com-privacy-online-privacy-notice.go-request_locale=en_US.html#advertising-on-our-sites" target="_blank">opt out of online behavioral advertising</a>. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.</p>
<p>Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.</p>
